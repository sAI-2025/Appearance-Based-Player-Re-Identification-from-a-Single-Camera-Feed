## 📌 Project Objective

This project tackles the challenge of **re-identifying football players** in a single video feed using an appearance-based strategy. Even when players temporarily leave the frame, the system ensures they retain the same identity upon re-entry.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

* Python 3.10+
* pip
* Jupyter Notebook
* OpenCV (cv2)
* CUDA (if using GPU)

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sAI-2025/Appearance-Based-Player-Re-Identification-from-a-Single-Camera-Feed.git
cd Appearance-Based-Player-Re-Identification-from-a-Single-Camera-Feed/code
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 How It Works (Methodology)

This system is designed to simulate real-time re-identification. It uses a multi-stage modular pipeline:

### 1. 🎯 Player Detection (YOLOv11)

* Pretrained YOLOv11 model detects `player` and `goalkeeper`.
* Filters out ball, referees, and irrelevant classes using confidence thresholding and color heuristics.

### 2. 🆔 Initial Identity Assignment

* Unique IDs are assigned to players in the first few seconds.
* Appearance features are extracted and stored as identity references.

### 3. 🎨 Appearance Embedding Extraction

A hybrid descriptor is computed using:

* **Color Histograms (HSV)**: capture jersey color.
* **Sobel Texture Filters**: capture logos, numbers, and detail.
* Compared using **cosine similarity** for consistency and accuracy.

### 4. 🕵️‍♂️ Frame-by-Frame Tracking

Each new detection is matched to existing tracks using a **multi-metric cost matrix**:

* Centroid distance (Euclidean)
* Appearance similarity (cosine)
* IoU score (overlap)

A greedy assignment algorithm ensures optimal matching.

### 5. 👀 Occlusion Handling & Re-Entries

* Tracks that disappear are timestamped and monitored.
* On reappearance, embeddings are compared to reassign the correct previous ID.

### 6. 🔄 Track Management

* Tracks are labeled as `active`, `disappeared`, or `removed`.
* Old tracks are pruned if missing for too long.

### 7. 🖼️ Visualization & Output

Each frame is annotated with:

* Bounding Boxes
* Unique Player IDs
* Detection Confidence

Final annotated video is exported to the `results/` folder.

## ⚠️ Challenges Tackled

### Referee Misclassification

* Referees in yellow were often misclassified as players.
* **Color-based filtering**: Detections with >30% yellow pixels were discarded.
* **Raised confidence threshold** to 0.92 helped filter noisy detections.

### Real-Time Constraints

* Designed a lightweight hybrid descriptor.
* Optimized assignment and pruning logic for frame-rate efficiency.

| Feature                      | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Re-Identification Logic**  | Maintains IDs across disappearances and occlusions                         |
| **Color + Texture Matching** | Improves robustness over plain color matching                              |
| **Multi-Metric Tracking**    | Combines spatial and appearance cues for more accurate matching            |
| **Smart Filtering**          | Prevents tracking referees or misclassified players using color heuristics |

## 📽️ Output Results

Annotated videos are saved in the `results/` directory:

* ✅ `submit1.mp4` — Demonstration of ID re-assignment and consistent tracking
* ✅ `submit2.mp4` — (Optional) Alternate test case or variation

---

## 👩‍💻 Run the Notebook

From the root directory:

```bash
cd code
jupyter notebook titled.ipynb
```

Run all cells to process the video and generate annotated outputs.
